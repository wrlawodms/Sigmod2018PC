- a brief description of the solution
    1. Fully Task pool model
        All tasks including parsing query and all operators are divided in small tasks and processed.
        Cache size and cache locality are considered for dividing tasks.
    2. Partitioning Hash join
        Our main algorithm for solving this probmen is the  partitioning hash join algorithm, not the radix hash join.
    3. Lock-free
        There is no explicit lock or wait except the lock waiting for end of processing a batch queries.
    4. MemoryPool
        -Thread Local Buddy allocator
    5. Query Optimization
        1)Filter propagation
        2)Filter first join order
        3)Removing Redundant join operator
        4)For duplicated Keys
            -Add count column for it if needed.
    6. Some optimization..
